#  Mechanical Analysis of a Cessna 172 Aircraft Wing

<details>
  <summary><b>What?</b> (click to expand)</summary>
  <br>

  I analyzed the structural integrity of a Cessna 172 wing spar under a conservative loading case (⅓ max takeoff weight) to identify the critical section and assess safety under bending and shear.

  <br>

  The wing was simplified into a beam with pinned–strut support. Reaction forces were solved using equilibrium and compatibility equations, followed by shear force and bending moment calculations using Macaulay’s method. Stresses at the critical section were evaluated using Mohr’s Circle and Tresca/Von Mises criteria.

  <br>

  The baseline design did not meet safety margin requirements, prompting design improvements involving material and geometric changes. These modifications achieved a target factor of safety of 1.5 while maintaining small wingtip deflection.

#  Transient Response Analysis of RC & RL Circuits (Lab + Multisim)

<details>
  <summary><b>What?</b> (click to expand)</summary>
  <br>

  This project investigated the transient response of first-order RC and RL circuits subjected to step inputs, focusing on time constants and agreement between theory, simulation, and experiment.

  <br>

  Voltage and current responses were measured during step excitation, and time constants were extracted using the 63.2% method. Multisim was used to simulate circuit behavior, and Thevenin equivalents were applied to simplify resistor networks.

  <br>

  Experimental results closely matched theoretical predictions, confirming the validity of first-order models. Small discrepancies were attributed to component tolerances, measurement limitations, and non-ideal behavior.

#  Modelling of Mechatronic Systems Using Mechanical–Electrical Analogies

<details>
  <summary><b>What?</b> (click to expand)</summary>
  <br>

  I studied the dynamic response of a mass–spring–damper system and a flexible beam under base excitation, then recreated both systems using equivalent RLC circuits to demonstrate mechanical–electrical analogies.

  <summary><b>How?</b> (click to expand)</summary>
  <br>

  Time- and frequency-domain response data were used to estimate natural frequency and damping ratio. MATLAB models were developed for validation, and mechanical parameters were mapped to equivalent RLC circuit components.

  The electrical analog models successfully reproduced key features of the mechanical response, including resonance and damping trends. Differences highlighted the impact of friction and real-world non-idealities.
