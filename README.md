# Modelling of Mechatronic Systems Using Mechanical–Electrical Analogies

<details>
  <summary><b>What?</b></summary>
  <br>

 The objective of this project was to model and predict the dynamic response of a coupled mechanical system subjected to base excitation, and to demonstrate that its behavior can be accurately represented using an equivalent electrical circuit.

A mass–spring–damper (MSD) system and a flexible vertical beam were experimentally and numerically characterized to extract key system parameters such as natural frequency and damping ratio. These mechanical systems were then converted into equivalent RLC circuits, allowing the same dynamic behavior to be analyzed in the electrical domain. The final goal was to validate that the combined MSD–beam system and its electrical analog exhibit consistent transient and frequency-response characteristics under base excitation.

  <summary><b>How?</b></summary>
  <br>

  Using MATLAB and Simulink with given codes, we gave a step input to OSCAR where a response would be shown on a graph through the software. We took multiple trials using different spring constants and settled with one trial using 1226N/m as the spring constant. We extracted system parameters using the logarthmic decrement method and mapped these parameters to equivalent RLC circuit values. The beam would have its own RLC values creating a parallel circuit with the MSD values. The circuits voltages were measured in a way where CH 1 was the MSD's capacitor voltage and CH 2 was the beam's capacitor voltage. Furthermore, square and sine wave inputs at differing frequencies were used to analyze the amplitudes and phase shifts among the frequency response.

  <summary><b>Result</b></summary>
  <br>

  The system evidently provided an underdamped response mapping an eqquivalent RLC circuit shown in the above section. The amplitudes measured from the oscilloscope under sine wave excitations yielded a maximum amplitude of 840mV at 500Hz for Channel 1 and 32.8mV at 7000Hz for Channel 2. The maximum phase shift obtained was 342.2 degrees at 7000Hz.

# Transient Response of Multi-Resistor RC Circuits Using Multisim

<details>
  <summary><b>What?</b></summary>
  <br>

The objective was to examine the first-order transient response of a multi-resistor circuit containing a dependent source by utilizing Thevenin’s theory to
measure the time constant. The circuit topology included a switch where I must validate discharging and charging behaviour of the system.

    <sub>Multi-resistor RC circuit schematic with a dependent source.</sub>
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How?</b></summary>
  <br>

  An applied step excitation to the circuit created in Multisim was used to further analyze the charging behaviour and obtain the time constant of the system. Using voltage and time cursors on the oscilliscope would then yield the effective time constant of the system. To validate theoretical predictions, I compared simulated behavior with hand calculations using equivalent resistance methods.

  The time constant came out to be 400ms and matched theoretical predictions with zero percent error.

# Mechanical Analysis of a Cessna 172 Aircraft Wing

<details>
  <summary><b>What?</b></summary>
  <br>

  Analyzed the structural integrity of a Cessna 172 wing spar under a conservative loading case (⅓ maximum takeoff weight) to identify the critical section governing bending and shear behavior. We also must evaluate whether our component will fail due to internal stresses during flight and the mode of failure.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>How?</b></summary>
  <br>

  Simplified the wing into an equivalent beam with pinned–strut support, which enabled us to solve reaction forces using equilibrium and compatibility equations. We also assumed drag to be negligible and that the lift force was uniform along the surface of the wing for ease of analysis. We then derived shear force and bending moment distributions using Macaulay’s method and evaluated stresses using Mohr’s Circle and ductile failure criteria.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Result</b></summary>
  <br>

  We found the critical point where the most bending and shear stress on the wing would be at x=1.7m (just before the wing strut). From our Mohr's circle stress and deformation calculations the wing would fail due to yielding as the component had a factor of safety of 0.66. We proposed design improvements including the usage of carbon fibre, or a higher yield strength of aluminum to prevent failure.

# Materials Selection: Aircraft Turbine Fan Blade

<details>
  <summary><b>What?</b></summary>
  <br>

  Selected an optimal material for a commercial aircraft turbine fan blade to minimize weight while meeting safety, durability, cost, thermal, and environmental constraints.

  <summary><b>How?</b></summary>
  <br>

 Modelled the blade with simplified geometry and screened 5 candidate materials in Granta EduPack 2024 R2 using constraint thresholds (e.g., max service temperature, fracture toughness), property charts (natural frequency vs allowable stress/density), and a weighted multi-criteria score across frequency, fracture toughness, price, density, and service temperature.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Result</b></summary>
  <br>

Identified Nickel-based superalloys as the best overall choice (balanced fatigue/temperature performance and acceptable environmental impact), with tungsten carbide as highest-performing but environmentally costly due to density, and high-carbon steel as a budget option with weaker high-temp/fatigue suitability.
