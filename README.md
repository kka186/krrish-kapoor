# ✈️ Mechanical Analysis of a Cessna 172 Aircraft Wing

<details>
  <summary><b>What?</b> (click to expand)</summary>
  <br>

  The objective of this project was to analyze the structural integrity of a Cessna 172 wing spar under a conservative loading case (⅓ maximum takeoff weight). The goal was to determine whether the wing could safely withstand bending and shear stresses and to identify the critical section governing failure.

  <br>

  The wing was simplified into a beam with pinned–strut support to represent realistic load transfer. Reaction forces were solved using equilibrium and compatibility equations, followed by shear force and bending moment derivations using Macaulay’s method. Internal stresses were evaluated at the critical section using Mohr’s Circle and Tresca/Von Mises failure criteria.

  <summary><b>Result</b> (click to expand)</summary>
  <br>

  The baseline design was found to have a factor of safety below acceptable limits, indicating yielding risk under the applied loading. Design improvements involving material substitution and geometric changes were proposed, targeting a factor of safety of 1.5 while maintaining acceptable deflection and load distribution.
